# Amazon Clone Website 🛒

Welcome to the repository for my **Amazon Clone Website**! This project is an attempt to replicate the Amazon homepage, built entirely with **HTML** and **CSS**. It has been an exciting and valuable journey for improving my front-end skills, especially in **HTML5** and **CSS**. While the website is not fully responsive yet, it's a great learning exercise for building web layouts and practicing design techniques.
